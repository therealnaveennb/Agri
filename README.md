WDC 2.0 Income Prediction System leverages AI to forecast alternate sources of income generated from Watershed Development Component (WDC) 2.0 in India. Watersheds play a pivotal role in rural development, agriculture, and livelihoods. The system predicts income generated by farmers, beneficiaries, and common people through Water Harvesting Structures (WHS) under WDC 2.0. Cutting-edge techniques such as aquaculture, hydroponics, and fisheries are integrated into the watershed.
